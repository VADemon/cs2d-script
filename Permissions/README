Welcome to the Permissions Help File!


- What is the Permissions plugin? -
Permissions is a highly customizable plugin that allows you to give rights to certain people or groups.
You don't have to edit settings of an each new plugin/script to allow all of it's features only to a couple of persons. With Permissions *you* decide which features a player is able to use!

- How it works -
All you need is Permissions and another script that uses Permissions. The developer of this script tells you the corresponding permission node for every command.
So, for example, to allow a player/group the usage of command "!ban" you have to add the permission node "adminScriptName.command.ban"
If the player doesn't have that permission node he won't be able to use this command because he hasn't the permission to do that. It's actually pretty simple!

Additional info will be added while developing the plugin.

Sincerely, VADemon
